# CSCore-Core  .NET Audio Library #
This is a fork of the https://github.com/filoe/cscore project.

Development on CSCore stopped at .NET Framework4.5.  This repo is an update
that builds in .NET Core (currently .NET 8.0).  I did this because I am interested in continuing
development on this code base and adding some additional features. Although this codebase
will be periodically released as a Nuget package **it should be considered experimental**.
If the existing Framework 4.5 CSCore nuget does what you need, I recommend you use it as
its is proven quality. But if you need the features I am working on, or want to add features of
your own, this is a place to start.

Release Status: 
1.0beta Compiling and seeimingly working but not fully tested
